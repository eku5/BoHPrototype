Her dad wakes up and tells Tori he would like to see the Bank of Hope destroyed. 
He falls back to sleep again. 
Tori is confused because this is not any kind of hope.

Choice – does Peter want hope of truth? 
->Yes – end game
->No – continue
    Tori decides to save the homeless people by stealing hope of safety. 
    She gives it to them. They wake up but one of them triggers the siren.
    The mom confronts Tori. Tori realizes that her dad left her mom because of this. 
    Choice – forgive Sammy? 
    ->No – end game. 
    ->Yes – continue

        Tori understands that no matter what her mom or dad have done, they’re still her parents. 
        She gives Peter hope of forgiveness.

This is the heaviest textbook Tori has ever seen. Tori tosses it into her locker.
A hand taps on her shoulder. She turns back and sees -
Cameron, cute, rebellious, long bangs almost cover his eyes. 
Tori: Jesus, you scared me.
Cameron stares at her with his green eyes but doesn't say anything. 
Oh, Tori would love to see his cute face every day, or even better, stroke his cheeks...
CAMERON: How was it?
Tori realizes what Cameron is asking and pretends to be cool.
TORI: What? Oh, the bank?
->It was okay.
    Cameron shrugs.
    CAMERON: Really? I heard there were at least 200 people. I feel bad for them.
->It was bad.
    Cameron raises his eyebrows.
    CAMERON: Oh, you think so? You know what, I kind of agree...
->It was so cool!
    Cameron looks suspicious.
    CAMERON: Which part is cool? Capitalism finding a way of commoditizing everything?
Tori stares at Cameron.
TORI: Why did you say that?
CAMERON: It’s...sorry, it’s personal.
TORI: Apparently it’s because of the bank. Come on, tell me.
Cameron shakes his head.
CAMERON: Don’t worry about it, I’ll see you in 6th period.
Tori: Wait...
Cameron checks his watch and walks off. Tori looks at his back, "personal"? What can't she know? Tori doesn’t understand why Cameron is acting so weird.

Tori, still has her backpack on, cranes her head in at the door and sees her dad PETER LEE (45) sleeping on his laptop. He has a long face and black stubble on his chin.
The entire desk is piled with books and sketches. Silently fuming, Tori steps into the study.
Something in the air feels weird. Maybe it's the absence of the smell of coffee, or maybe it's the quietness.
TORI: Dad, would you extract hope for money?
Peter doesn’t wake up.
TORI: Dad? I’ve been thinking about it. I mean, I get it that some people might think they don’t need hope.
Peter remains unconscious.
TORI: Wake up.
Tori leans to check on Peter. She shakes Peter’s shoulders.
TORI: Dad?
Peter slides off the chair and falls onto the floor.
TORI: DAD!!!

Outside a closed patient room, Tori sits on one of the chairs next to the wall alone, face buried in her hands.
She always hates hospitals the the smell of medicine. She hates the despair and the endless wait.
<<set $soundIndex to 2>>
CLICK CLICK, Nicole appears at the end of the hallway with the sound of high heels. Tori looks up. Nicole strides to take Tori into her arms.
TORI: This wouldn’t have happened if you guys stayed together.
NICOLE: I...
TORI: Can you move back in to take care of dad?
NICOLE: I don’t know --
CRACK. The door opens. A DOCTOR walks out with a binder. Nicole and Tori both stand up.
DOCTOR: Are you immediate family members of Mr. Peter Lee?
NICOLE: Yes, I’m his wife. This is our daughter.
TORI: Is my dad okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, he is awake now.
Tori and Nicole sigh with relief.
NICOLE: Thank you!
DOCTOR: However, we went through his test results, and the biopsy showed signs of large cell non-hodgkin's lymphoma.
NICOLE: What is that?
DOCTOR: It’s a form of cancer. And I’m afraid that we didn’t catch it very early.
Nicole covers her mouth with her hand and closes her eyes. Tori can't believe what's happening to her and her family. This feels like a movie, she thinks.
She sees tears rolling down Nicole's cheeks. Everything seems surreal.

Peter, in patient’s robe, lies in bed. His face is a little pale and tired.
Through the glass window on the other side of the room, Nicole is talking to the doctor outside.
Tori sits next to his bed, holding his hands. 
Peter has always been strong and healthy. Aren't dads always healthy? But now he looks weak and tired. Tori wants to lean on his shoulders, 
like what she used to do when bad things happened. But she can't anymore.
Tori takes a deep breath and tries to put herself together.
TORI: What do you mean you don’t want to do anything?
PETER: You heard what the doctor said, this type of cancer doesn’t respond well to chemotherapeutic drugs.
TORI: What about the other treatment they mentioned?
PETER: 50% survival rate is basically nothing.
TORI: What if there’s miracle?
PETER: Miracles don’t usually happen, that’s what miracles mean.
TORI: ...Do you not want to be with us?
Peter holds Tori’s hand tighter.
PETER: Of course I want to be with you, but I don’t want to get your hope up and disappoint you...I’ve been there, it was worse than not having any hope at all.
TORI: But now it’s different than Grandma’s time period.
PETER: Not a lot.
TORI: Dad, please!
PETER: Do you not remember what Grandma had looked like before she went through the treatment? And what happened to her afterwards?
Tori lowers her head.
TORI: I didn’t understand when she told me the inside of her bones hurt...
PETER: Yeah, probably not worth it.
TORI: Can you just...just do it for my sake? Please?
Tori shakes Peter’s arm with anger. Peter touches Tori’s head.
PETER: I am doing what’s best for you and your mom. You’ll understand when you grow up.
TORI: Stop saying shit like that. It doesn’t even mean anything!
NICOLE: Language.
Nicole walks into the room.
TORI: WHAT’S WRONG WITH YOU GUYS????
NICOLE: Tori!

Tori is having lunch with Cameron. Although the fries are not bad today, she doesn’t seem to enjoy them. Cameron takes some fries from her plate.
TORI: Hey!
CAMERON: I’m sorry, you stopped eating so I grabbed some -
TORI: No, I’ve got an idea.
CAMERON: Okay...?
TORI: What if I inject hope into my dad’s body?
Cameron is alert. He looks a little nervous but Tori doesn’t know why.
CAMERON: What do you mean inject? No...nobody has done that. I mean,
TORI: The worst thing that might happen is that he has extra hope in his body, what’s wrong with that?
CAMERON: Nothing...but..
TORI: What?
CAMERON: Nothing, where are you getting hope from?
TORI: The bank, of course, we sneak into the bank, use the machine and reverse the process.
CAMERON: And we steal the hope?
TORI: Yes.
CAMERON: I’m in.
TORI: What? I didn’t ask you to join me.
Cameron downs his orange juice.
CAMERON: I said I’m in.

Tori and Cameron, both wear hoodies, enter the bank. 
They try to act normal and avoid eye contact with the guards. The guards don’t pay extra attention to them.
They stop in front of a stairwell. Tori leans against the wall, looking around. 
Meanwhile, a staff memeber walks towards them. She sees Tori and waves to her.

->Say hi to the staff.
    Tori smiles politely and waves to the staff.
    STAFF: Aren’t you Nicole’s daughter? You did an excellent job on the first day. Are you looking for Nicole?
    ->TORI: Yes.
        STAFF: Oh, she’s right in her office, do you wanna follow me?
        Tori mouths to Cameron: “Wait here”. She walks off with the staff.
        The staff member is about to turn right, this is a good chance to escape.
        TORI: I’m sorry, I need to use the bathroom so bad, I’ll find my mom on my own thank you very much bye.
        She runs off.
    ->TORI: No, I’m just chilling. Please don’t mind me.
        The staff members’s eyes dart between Tori and Cameron. 
        She gets it, Cameron is probably Tori’s crush. What a cute couple, she thinks.
        STAFF: Oh, okay, enjoy!
        TORI: Thanks.
        The staff memeber leaves.
->Lower your head.
    Tori lowers her head, staff looks at Tori for a bit, confused. 
    But she turns around, walks straight past them and disappears.
->Walk away from the stairwell.
    Tori walks away from the stairwell, she wanders in the lobby until the staff walks past Cameron.
    CAMERON: She’s gone.
    Tori goes back to Cameron.

Tori opens the lid of the recycling bin. Cameron glances at the food waste bin next to the recycling bin. 
He frowns.
TORI: What’s wrong?
CAMERON: I’ll take that one.
TORI: Are you sure? No, I dragged you into this, I don’t want you to -
CAMERON: It’s fine, your hoodie looks nicer.
TORI: No...
Cameron opens the lid and jumps into the food waste bin.
TORI: Cameron!
CAMERON: Shh, it’s actually not bad in here.
Tori feels bad, but she has no choice but to hide into the recycling bin.
TORI: I owe you ice cream.
They wait in the bins.

Tori uses her flashlight to lighten up the storage. There is a very big crystal globe in the middle of the room. 
Tori approaches it, she opens her mouth and GASPS -
TORI: Cameron!
CAMERON: What’s going on? The crystal globe is empty.
TORI: Why is the storage empty?
To Tori’s surprise, Cameron seems very angry.
CAMERON: There is no hope left in the storage?! They took it all????
TORI: Who took it?
CAMERON: No, sorry, nothing.
TORI: You know something about it, don’t you? Is that why you really wanted to come with me?
CAMERON: No, I don’t.
TORI: Cameron. I need you to tell me what you know.
CAMERON: I’m sorry Tori, I...I can’t.

Tori follows Cameron to an abandoned school. Now she’s standing in a dark, long school hall way. 
The classroom doors are shut. The walls look worn out and old.
Tori shivers. Where did Cameron go?
<<set $soundIndex to 8>>
CRACK! 
A door opens at the end of the hallway. Tori GASPS. Cameron hears Tori’s voice, hesitates and walks towards her. 
Tori leans against the wall, holding her breath.
LAURA, Cameron’s mom, stops him.
LAURA (to Cameron): Where are you going? People are waiting, I need your help, please.
Still staring at where Tori is, Cameron reluctantly follows Laura into a classroom.
Tori waits, and goes to the classroom.
Tori widens her eyes. A small group of people sit at the desks, wearing the same head bands that Tori saw at the Bank of Hope. 
On the desks, the yellow gas inside the crystal balls is shrinking and eventually disappears.
The people open their eyes. They stand up, dance and LAUGH hysterically.
Cameron and Laura help the people take off the head bands. Tori can’t believe what she’s seeing.
One of the people takes out his wallet and pulls out several hundred dollar bills and hands them to Cameron.
Expressionless, Cameron takes the money. Tori is thunderstruck.

She puts on the head band in darkness and presses a button. She closes her eyes.
Suddenly, Nicole storms in.
NICOLE: What are you doing here?
TORI: Mom?
Nicole forces Tori to take off the head band. Tori struggles.
NICOLE: This is not a toy. Who told you to come here?
TORI: Mom, have you been giving hope to people? And...they sell it?
Nicole is taken aback.
NICOLE: No, Tori.
TORI: She knows you. And she knows my name.
Nicole lowers her head.
NICOLE: It was the CEO’s decision, not mine.
TORI: And you didn’t say anything about it?
NICOLE: I can’t. Tori, you don’t understand.
TORI: The hope you’ve been giving to them doesn’t even work! I gave it to dad and he just...became weird. He couldn’t recognize me.
Nicole grabs Tori’s shoulders.
NICOLE: You did what?
TORI: I wanted dad to get the treatment...
NICOLE: Of course it doesn’t work. Hope is bad! Everyone only hopes for themselves, can’t you see?
TORI: I don’t only hope for myself.
NICOLE: You hope that dad is healthy so he could be with you.
TORI: Yeah...that’s true.
NICOLE: Hope is selfish.

TORI: Dad?
Peter sees Tori, confused.
PETER: I didn’t know child stars were nominated.
TORI: Dad, what are you talking about?
PETER: Dad? Sorry, that’s not very respectful. I’m single.
TORI: Would you get the treatment now?
PETER: Um, where’s your family, kid? Can I help you?
Peter suddenly freezes and stops walking. 
Joy disappears from his face and is replaced by seriousness.
PETER: What was that, Tori?
Tori seems lost.
TORI: You remember me now?
PETER: What have you done? I tried so hard to come back to reality.
TORI: I’m sorry, I just wanted to --
PETER: That’s not I want, Tori.

There are so many people here, maybe a little bit too many.
Tori feels like she is at a market instead of a bank.
She turns and glances at the people around her: In their eyes, some sorrow, some expectation. Why don’t they look very happy? Tori asks herself.
There is a stage at the center of the lobby. A spotlight shines on a small potted tree in the corner of the stage.
Nicole stands on the stage. She's charismatic and modern. The sight calls to mind a Steve Jobs product launch or Gwyneth Paltrow delivering a TED talk.
<<set $soundIndex to 2>>
NICOLE (to crowd): So, is everyone ready to get rid of some hope?
She waits. 
<<set $soundIndex to 4>>
Some people CHEER.
NICOLE (to crowd): I assume you came here because you all agree with me - hope is selfish and often causes false expectation? Stay present, worry free, stop thinking and hoping about the future!
People clap.
NICOLE: I’m honored to introduce our service to all of you. This is the first branch of Bank of Hope worldwide!
We operate through the most cutting-edge technology. No matter who you are and what you do, Bank of Hope would take hope from you and pay you.
Tori frowns.
->I don’t know how I feel about this.
->I think my mom is right; hope is unnecessary.
    The world would be much simpler if we just do the work we ought to do.
->What? Hope is a good thing to have. Why would people do this?

Around 20 citrine yellow linen armchairs stand in rows, facing the glass dome window. In front of each armchair is a small table similar to the size of a night stand.
On each of the night stand is a minimalist adjustable head band and an empty crystal ball.
Nicole leads the group to the center of the room. 
She looks for Tori but Tori tries to hide herself behind another person.

NICOLE: I’d love to introduce my daughter Tori to you. She’ll be demonstrating the hope extracting process for you.
->Run away! 
    - Tori shoulders through the people but is pulled back by a hand. She looks up and meets Nicole’s eyes.
    NICOLE: Where are you going? You promised.
->Okay...I guess I’ll do it...
    - Tori reluctantly nods and follows her. She sits on an armchair.
    ->One more minute...
    ->Yes.
    ->I don’t want to do this.
->Tell everyone that I don’t want to.
    TORI (to Nicole): I don’t want to do this.
    NICOLE: What are you talking about?
Tori could hear people GOSSIP. They stare at her, judging. Tori gives in.
TORI: Sorry, I’m a little scared.
NICOLE: You’re going to be fine, sweet pea.
<<set $soundIndex to 5>>
Nicole helps Tori to wear a head band.

People lean forward to have a better look at the crystal ball.

Some people take pictures.

She connects the crystal ball to the head band. 
The front of the head band lightens up with an indicator.
NICOLE (to Tori): Ready?
TORI: Okay, I’m ready.
<<set $soundIndex to 6>>
Nicole presses a button on the controller attached to the armrest. The armchair leans back. Tori closes her eyes.
Some yellow gas appears in the crystal ball. Tori’s face twitches. She feels lost and empty, like someone who has been hold onto her just disappeared. Stop it! That’s enough! She thinks.
But Nicole is looking at the yellow gas, amazed. Tori tries to open her eyes but she is paralyzed. Tori is about to lose conscious. Darkness...
<<set $soundIndex to 16>>
Beep.
Nicole finally pushes the button on the controller but it’s too late -
The machine already stopped injecting automatically. Tori opens her eyes, she sits up.
NICOLE (to Tori): How do you feel?
Tori stands up and looks at her own fingers. People take out phones and open their cameras to record this moment. Nicole puts up a even bigger smile.
TORI: I feel alright.
TORI: Are you going to pay me now?
<<set $soundIndex to 18>>
Nicole is a little relieved. People CLAP.
The crowd LAUGHS, Nicole LAUGHS with them.
