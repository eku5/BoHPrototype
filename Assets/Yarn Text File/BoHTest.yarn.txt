There are so many people here, maybe a little bit too many.
Tori feels like she is at a market instead of a bank.
She turns and glances at the people around her: In their eyes, some sorrow, some expectation. Why don’t they look very happy? Tory asks herself.
There is a stage at the center of the lobby. A spotlight shines on a small potted tree in the corner of the stage.
Nicole stands on the stage. She's charismatic and modern. The sight calls to mind a Steve Jobs product launch or Gwyneth Paltrow delivering a TED talk.
NICOLE (to crowd): So, is everyone ready to get rid of some hope?
She waits. Some people CHEER.
NICOLE (to crowd): I assume you came here because you all agree with me - hope is selfish and often causes false expectation? Stay present, worry free, stop thinking and hoping about the future!
People clap.
NICOLE: I’m honored to introduce our service to all of you. This is the first branch of Bank of Hope worldwide!
We operate through the most cutting-edge technology. No matter who you are and what you do, Bank of Hope would take hope from you and pay you.
Tori frowns.
->I don’t know how I feel about this.
->I think my mom is right; hope is unnecessary.
    The world would be much simpler if we just do the work we ought to do.
->What? Hope is a good thing to have. Why would people do this?

Around 20 citrine yellow linen armchairs stand in rows, facing the glass doom window. In front of each armchair is a small table similar to the size of a night stand.
On each of the night stand is a minimalist adjustable head band and an empty crystal ball.
Nicole leads the group to the center of the room. 
She looks for Tori but Tori tries to hide herself behind another person.

NICOLE: I’d love to introduce my daughter Tori to you. She’ll be demonstrating the hope extracting process for you.
->Run away! 
    - Tori shoulders through the people but is pulled back by a hand. She looks up and meets Nicole’s eyes.
    NICOLE: Where are you going? You promised.
->Okay...I guess I’ll do it...
    - Tori reluctantly nods and follows her. She sits on an armchair.
    Nicole helps Tori to wear a head band.
    People lean forward to have a better look at the crystal ball. 
    Some people take pictures.
    She connects the crystal ball to the head band. 
    The front of the head band lightens up with an indicator.
    NICOLE (to Tori): Ready?
    ->One more minute...
    ->Yes.
    ->I don’t want to do this.
->Tell everyone that you don’t want to.
    TORI (to Nicole): I don’t want to do this.
    NICOLE: What are you talking about?
Tori could hear people GOSSIP. They stare at her, judging. Tori gives in.
TORI: Sorry, I’m a little scared.
NICOLE: You’re going to be fine, sweet pea.
TORI: Okay, I’m ready.
Nicole presses a button on the controller attached to the
armrest. The armchair leans back. Tori closes her eyes.

->END FOR NOW
    Tori (15) comes home to see her dad, Peter Lee, lying on the floor.

    Tori gets him to the emergency room.
->STOP PLAYING
    Tori's mother, Sammy Lee, gives an introduction to the valued customers that are invited to attend the grand opening. 
    Sammy gives a tutorial on how to choose the kind of hope the customers want.
Tori's dad is in a coma. Tori regrets that she hasn’t been nice to her dad. 
She believes that getting him a vial of hope will wake him up.

Choice – does Peter want hope of truth? 
->Yes – end game
->No – continue
    Tori decides to save the homeless people by stealing hope of safety. 
    She gives it to them. They wake up but one of them triggers the siren.

    Choice – forgive Sammy? 
    ->No – end game. 
    ->Yes – continue

        Tori understands that no matter what her mom or dad have done, they’re still her parents.
